[Money](https://github.com/clojurewerkz/money) is a Clojure library that deals with monetary amounts
and currencies, built on top of [Joda Money](http://joda-money.sourceforge.net/).

`1.2.0` is a minor release that has no breaking API changes and contains
support for additional currencies.



## Changes between Money 1.1.0 and 1.2.0
