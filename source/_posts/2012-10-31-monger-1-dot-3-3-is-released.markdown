## TL;DR

Monger is an idiomatic [Clojure MongoDB driver](http://clojuremongodb.info) for a more civilized age.
It has batteries included, offers powerful expressive query DSL, strives to support every MongoDB 2.0+ feature and has sane defaults.
It also has [solid documentation](http://clojuremongodb.info).

`1.3.3` is a minor *100% backwards-compatible* release that includes an updated MongoDB Java driver dependency and data.json `0.2.x` support.
We recommend all users to upgrade to it as soon as possible.


## Changes between 1.3.2 and 1.3.3

### ClojureWerkz Support Upgrade

ClojureWerkz Support dependency has been updated to version `0.9.0`. JSON serializer extensions (`clojurewerkz.support.json`, formerly `monger.json`)
now support data.json `0.2.x`.

`1.3.1` and `1.3.2` release change logs are included below for completeness, since they also resolve issues around data.json API changes and
MongoDB Java driver dependency updates.


## Changes between 1.3.1 and 1.3.2

### MongoDB Java Driver Update

MongoDB Java driver dependency has been updated to 2.9.3.


## Changes between 1.3.0 and 1.3.1

### ClojureWerkz Support Upgrade

ClojureWerkz Support dependency has been updated to version `0.8.0` and fixes an issue with data.json being extended
from `monger.json` even when it is not available.
