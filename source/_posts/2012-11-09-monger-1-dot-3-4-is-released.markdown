## TL;DR

Monger is an idiomatic [Clojure MongoDB driver](http://clojuremongodb.info) for a more civilized age.
It has batteries included, offers powerful expressive query DSL, strives to support every MongoDB 2.0+ feature and has sane defaults.
It also has [solid documentation](http://clojuremongodb.info).

`1.3.4` is a minor *100% backwards-compatible* release that eliminates more `data.json` dependencies in `monger.json`.
We recommend all users to upgrade to it as soon as possible.


## Changes between 1.3.3 and 1.3.4

### data.json Dependency Fixes

`monger.json` no longer requires `data.json` to be present at compile time.
