## Accepting Donations

ClojureWerkz was started in mid-2011 because we were frustrated with a
couple of database and messaging libraries that were very popular in
the Clojure community at the time. We were also frustrated with the
"culture" of not documenting projects. So developed [a
library](http://clojurerabbitmq.info) the way we wanted. Then [another
one](http://clojuremongodb.info). And [another
one](http://clojureriak.info).  Today, we find ourselves with dozens
of projects that keep moving and have enough users to require us do
some support. All of this is both exciting and time consuming. In
2011, the core team that did most of the development was 2 people. In
2013, it is 3 people: [Michael](http://twitter.com/michaelklishin),
[Alex](http://twitter.com/ifesdjeen), [Zack
Maril](http://twitter.com/zackmaril).

From time to time, we get the question: is it possible to donate to
the project?  Today we are happy to report that we have first two
donation options ready to be announced. That's right: now you can
donate to ClojureWerkz.


## How to Donate

### PayPal

The easiest way to donate is with PayPal: `donate@clojurewerkz.org`.


### Bitcoin

Our Bitcoin wallet is `1PpoesdZ4XfP9AacFFFvseWEN8jfiChBmH`.


## Why Donate

Over years, we've developed and open sourced [dozens of Clojure
libraries](http://clojurewerkz.org). It took time to develop and
document them (as a benchmark: [Elastisch
documentation](http://clojureelasticsearch.info) took solidly more
than 100 hours alone).  Some of them are known to be best in their
class in the Clojure community.

In addition, we continue to maintain and improve them. This also takes
time. By donating you help the core team justify spending all this
time on open source software and help make the Clojure community a
better place, both in terms of solid libraries available and spreading
the culture of documenting and maintaining libraries well.


## Get In Touch

If you have any questions about donations, please contact us as `donate@clojurewerkz.org`.


## FAQ

### Why Only These Limited Options?

Services such as GitTip do not work with banks in most countries. PayPal does not let residents
of some countries accept payments. Stripe requires you to set up a company or foundation before
you can accept card payments: this is something we are not yet ready to do.

In the end, the combination of popularity of PayPal and ease of accepting donations in Bitcoin
strike the right balance for us for now.


### What Will The Money Go To?

Maintaining our existing libraries and their docs, developing new ones.


### How Much Should I Donate?

It's up to you. We can give you a rule of thumb: if you use one or more of our libraries,
chances are, it's saved you at least one hour of time. So consider donating the amount you charge
for 1 hour.


### Can I Fund Development of a New Clojure Library?

Please contact us as `donate@clojurewerkz.org` and we will try to work something out. We have only
**one requirement**: we are not based in North America and will not travel in order to develop the project.

Let us know what you think [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/clojurewerkz) or [via email](mailto:donate@clojurewerkz.org).
