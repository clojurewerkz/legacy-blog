## TL;DR

If you use a [ClojureWerkz project](http://clojurewerkz.org) (or two), please [tell us](mailto:michael@defprotocol.org) a little bit about your
project, your team size and what libraries do you find missing in the Clojure ecosystem.



## A Bit of History

When ClojureWerkz was started in mid-2011, the goal had been to release a number of Clojure libraries
we needed under a [liberal license](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html) that other people will find useful. One and a half years later,
there are some additional goals behind the project but ultimately it all comes down to sharing
projects that are *useful and easy to use*. We are not fans of highly esoteric, experimental,
may-or-may-not-work kind of stuff.

Reading CS papers and implementing what's there is great
but for younger languages such as Clojure, nothing matters more than solid libraries for
boring problems. We developed first ClojureWerkz libraries while working on products that
involved a lot of data processing, so data store clients was a natural thing to contribute.

Needless to say, we are very happy to see when other people use our libraries.


## ClojureWerkz Projects in the Wild

Sometimes we learn about companies and project that use our stuff because their engineers contribute
something or simply file an issue. Sometimes they contact us to tell that they appreciate our attention
to documentation. Sometimes we hear our libraries mentioned in talks about Clojure adoption, like
this talk on [Clojure at Nokia](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/clojure-at-nokia-entertainment/te-6533).

There are large and small companies on the list of contributors and adopters. But we probably don't
know about 95+% of them. Curious as we are, we figured its time to reach out and learn a little
bit more about how our libraries are used.


## We Want to Improve

But it's not just about stroking our egos. It is also about improving our projects.
If our stuff sucks or is really hard to adopt, our past, present and future efforts are in vain.

So, today we are asking our community for a little favor: [tell us how you use ClojureWerkz projects](mailto:michael@defprotocol.org)!
Share as much as you can or willing to:

 * Which projects do you use
 * What do you use them for
 * How large is your team. Was it easy to adopt our stuff?
 * What sucks about it?
 * What libraries do you think we should consider looking into in the future?

If we gather enough information about projects and companies, we will put together a testimonials page.
Maybe it will make it a bit easier to convince decision makers on your team to consider Clojure and
our libraries, maybe not. In any case, we will be more aware of how our work is used by other people.

And if email sounds like an old boring thing you no longer do, just share what you can [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/clojurewerkz)!

## Thank You!

Thank you to all our users and contributors. With [a number of project going 1.0 last year](/blog/2012/12/29/the-clojurewerkz-project-in-2012/),
we are very much only getting started with ClojureWerkz and very excited about what can
be improved with a little bit of community feedback.
