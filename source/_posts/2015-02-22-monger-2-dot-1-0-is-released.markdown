## TL;DR

Monger is an idiomatic [Clojure MongoDB driver](http://clojuremongodb.info) for a more civilized age.
It has batteries included, offers powerful expressive query DSL, strives to support every MongoDB 2.0+ feature and has sane defaults.
It also has [solid documentation](http://clojuremongodb.info).

`2.1.0` is a compatibility release. Next feature release of Monger will be `3.0` and will
use [version `3.0` of the MongoDB Java driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/releases/tag/r3.0.0-beta2).


## Changes between 2.0.0 and 2.1.0

### Clojure 1.7 Compatibility

Improved Clojure 1.7 (development milestone) releases.

### MongoDB Java Driver Update

MongoDB Java driver dependency has been updated to `2.13.x`.

### $each Operator

The `$each` operator now can be used via `monger.operators`.
