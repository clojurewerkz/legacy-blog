## TL;DR

The [Clojure documentation project](http://clojure-doc.org) continues to make progress.
Highlight of the last week include materials on [VimClojure](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/vim.html) by Dave Ray,
the [Clojure Maven plugin](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/ecosystem/maven.html) by Alex Ott, and
Intro to [Web development with Clojure](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/basic_web_development.html)
from John Gabriele.


## CDS Progress Report

The [Clojure Documentation
Site](http://clojure-doc.org) (a.k.a. CDS) publishes
periodic reports (every week so far, possibly two weeks in the future)
to give the Clojure community a better idea of what CDS shapes up to
be and what it has to offer.

This is a report for the week ending November 4th, 2012.


## New Content

New tuturials added this week:

 * [VimClojure](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/vim.html)
 * Intro to [Web development with Clojure](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/basic_web_development.html)

New guides added this week:

 * [Clojure Maven plugin](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/ecosystem/maven.html)
 * [Clojure User Groups](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/ecosystem/user_groups.html)


## Updates

Existing guides updated this week:

 * [clojure.core Overview](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/core_overview.html)



## Thank You, Contributors

CDS would not be possible without the following people who make the Clojure community a better place:

 * Alex Ott
 * Dave Ray
 * John Gabriele
 * Michael S. Klishin
 * Robert Randolph
 * Wes Freeman


## You Can Help!

### How It Works

We have [a repository on GitHub](http://github.com/clojuredocs/cds) that has Markdown files, toolchain setup instructions and several articles
as well as stubs for several more articles. The stubs help contributors pick a topic to write about and not worry too much about
article structure initially. Just pick something that you are very familiar with or interested in and write.

When you are done, submit a pull request on GitHub and someone from the existing contributors team will
suggest improvements or merge your work. Pretty straightforward.

In order to make it easier for potential contributors to join the project, we will post a brief list of
guides that do not require deep expertise and can benefit from contributions by complete beginners.

### Existing Guides

Guides that have structure and good chunk of the content in place but still have holes you
can help us plug:

 * [Java interop](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/interop.html)
 * [Collections and Sequences](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/sequences.html)
 * [Namespaces](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/namespaces.html)
 * [clojure.core Overview](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/core_overview.html)

These guides are new and cover advanced topics, so we need as much proof-reading as we can
get from the community:

 * [Concurrency and Parallelism in Clojure](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/concurrency_and_parallelism.html)

### New Content

If you want to start working on one of those articles or have existing content you've authored that can be ported,
please let us know on the [Clojure mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/clojure).


## Summary

This week we've addressed probably the most common request for CDS: the [VimClojure](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/vim.html) tutorial
(thanks to [Dave Ray](https://twitter.com/darevay)). Another thing we are happy about is that we've added a few new contributors.
