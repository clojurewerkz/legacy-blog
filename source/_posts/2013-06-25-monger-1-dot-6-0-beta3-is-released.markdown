## TL;DR

Monger is an idiomatic [Clojure MongoDB driver](http://clojuremongodb.info) for a more civilized age.
It has batteries included, offers powerful expressive query DSL, strives to support every MongoDB 2.0+ feature and has sane defaults.
It also has [solid documentation](http://clojuremongodb.info).

`1.6.0-beta3` is a milestone *completely backwards-compatible* release that includes updated
dependencies, an alternative API that makes it easier to work with multiple
databases and a few other minor features.



## Changes between 1.5.0 and 1.6.0

### monger.multi.collection

`monger.multi.collection` is a new namespace with functions that are very similar to those
in the `monger.collection` namespace but always take a database reference as an explicit argument.

They are supposed to be used in cases when relying on `monger.core/*mongodb-database*` is not
enough.

Erik Bakstad contributed most of this work.


### MongoDB Java Driver Update

MongoDB Java driver dependency has been [updated to 2.11.2](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/wiki/Release-Notes).


## monger.core/drop-db

`monger.core/drop-db` is a new function that drops a database by name.


### One More Cache Implementation

`monger.cache/db-aware-monger-cache-factory` will return a MongoDB-backed `clojure.core.cache`
implementation that can use any database:

``` clojure
(require '[monger.core  :as mg])
(require '[monger.cache :as cache])

(let [db   (mg/get-db "altcache")
      coll "cache_entries"
      c    (cache/db-aware-monger-cache-factory db coll)]
  (comment "This cache instance will use the altcache DB"))
```
