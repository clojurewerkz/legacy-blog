## TL;DR

[Cassaforte](http://clojurecassandra.info) is a Clojure client for
Apache Cassandra 1.2+. It is built around CQL 3 and focuses on ease
of use. You will likely find that using Cassandra from Clojure has
never been so easy.

`1.3.0-beta2` is a milestone release that upgrades Hayt which
contains a slew of bug fixes.


## Changes between Cassaforte 1.3.0-beta1 and 1.3.0-beta2

### Hayt Update

Hayt dependency has been updated to `1.4.1`, which supports
`if-not-exists` in `create-keyspace`:

``` clojure
(create-keyspace "main"
	         (if-not-exists)
	         (with {:replication
	                  {:class "SimpleStrategy"
	                   :replication_factor 1 }}))
```
