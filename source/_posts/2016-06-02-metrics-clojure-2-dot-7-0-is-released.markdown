## TL;DR

[metrics-clojure](https://github.com/sjl/metrics-clojure/) is a Clojure fa√ßade around Coda Hale's [Metrics](http://metrics.codahale.com) library,
originally developed by [Steve Losh](http://stevelosh.com/).

`metrics-clojure` is not a ClojureWerkz project but we help maintain it
and consider it to be a very valuable library.
