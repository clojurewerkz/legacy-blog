## TL;DR

[ClojureWerkz Mailer](https://github.com/clojurewerkz/mailer) is an
ActionMailer-inspired mailer library for Clojure. It combines
[Postal](https://github.com/drewr/postal),
[Clostache](https://github.com/fhd/clostache) and a number of its own
features and conventions to make delivering complex template-based
emails as painless as possible.


## Why Use Mailer

All the building blocks to make email rendering and delivery easy in
Clojure have been in place for a while, Mailer simply combines them
and brings in some time tested ideas from Action Mailer.


## What's In The Box

Mailer lets you:

 * Send email using pluggable transports
 * Use Moustache templates for email
 * Generate HTML and/or plain text email
 * Deliver mail over SMTP or Sendmail
 * Test rendered emails easily

## Documentation

Mailer is a small library and all of its [documentation guide fits in the README](https://github.com/clojurewerkz/mailer#documentation).


## Project Maturity

Mailer is a moderately mature project, the API hasn't changed in over a year.


## Supported Clojure Versions

Mailer supports Clojure 1.4+.
