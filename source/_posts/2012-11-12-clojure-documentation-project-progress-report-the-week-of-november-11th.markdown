## TL;DR

This week the [Clojure documentation project](http://clojure-doc.org) added two new materials
and a bunch of minor edits all over the place. The new additions are

 * [Parsing XML in Clojure](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/parsing_xml_with_zippers.html) by Gareth Jones
 * [Middleware in Client Libraries](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/cookbooks/middleware.html) by Lee Hinman


## Clojure Documentation Progress Report

The [Clojure Documentation
Site](http://clojure-doc.org) (a.k.a. CDS) publishes
periodic reports (every week so far, possibly two weeks in the future)
to give the Clojure community a better idea of what CDS shapes up to
be and what it has to offer.

This is a report for the week ending November 11th, 2012.


## New Content

New tuturials added this week:

 * [Parsing XML in Clojure](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/parsing_xml_with_zippers.html) (with zippers)

New guides added this week:

 * [Middleware in Client Libraries](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/cookbooks/middleware.html)


## Updates

Existing tutorials updated this week:

 * [Getting Started with Clojure and Emacs](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/emacs.html)

 * [Getting Started with VimClojure](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/vim.html)

Existing guides updated this week:

 * [Clojure User Groups](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/ecosystem/user_groups.html)

Most of of other edits here are not listed above because they are purely grammar and spelling fixes.

## You Can Help!

### How It Works

We have [a repository on GitHub](http://github.com/clojuredocs/cds) that has Markdown files with content and toolchain setup instructions.
Just pick something that you are very familiar with or interested in and write.

When you are done, submit a pull request on GitHub and someone from the existing contributors team will
suggest improvements or merge your work. It is that easy.

In order to make it easier for potential contributors to join the project, we will post a brief list of
guides that do not require deep expertise and can benefit from contributions by complete beginners.

### Existing Guides

Guides that have structure and good chunk of the content in place but still have holes you
can help us plug:

 * [Java interop](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/interop.html)
 * [Collections and Sequences](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/sequences.html)
 * [Namespaces](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/namespaces.html)
 * [clojure.core Overview](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/core_overview.html)


### New Content

If you want to start working on one of those articles or have existing content you've authored that can be ported,
please let us know on the [Clojure mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/clojure).
