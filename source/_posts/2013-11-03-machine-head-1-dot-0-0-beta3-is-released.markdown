## TL;DR

Machine Head is a small [Clojure MQTT client](http://clojuremqtt.info).

`1.0.0-beta3` is a development milestone which exposes a minor feature
in the Paho Java client.



## Changes between Machine Head 1.0.0-beta2 and 1.0.0-beta3

### Clean Session Support

`clojurewerkz.machine-head.client/connect` now supports one more
option: `:clean-session`. When set to true, the option means that
the client and MQTT broker should discard state that might have
been kept from earlier connections.
