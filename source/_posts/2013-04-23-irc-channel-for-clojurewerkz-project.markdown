## ClojureWerkz IRC Channel on Freenode

Every once in a while we get a request to start an IRC channel for our projects where
people can suggest ideas and ask questions.

We are happy to announce that we now have a channel: `#clojurewerkz` on `irc.freenode.net`.
There are no strict "office hours" but it is much more likely that we will be around
in European evening hours. Feel free to join and let us know how we can make ClojureWerkz
projects better.
