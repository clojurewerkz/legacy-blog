## TL;DR

[Pantomime](http://github.com/michaelklishin/pantomime) is a tiny Clojure library that deals with MIME types (Internet media types, "content types").
Pantomime 1.5 upgrades [Apache Tika to 1.3](http://www.apache.org/dist/tika/CHANGES-1.3.txt) and default Clojure dependency to 1.4.0.


## Changes between Pantomime 1.4.0 and 1.5.0

### Apache Tika 1.3

Apache Tika dependency has been upgraded to [version 1.3](http://www.apache.org/dist/tika/CHANGES-1.3.txt).

### Clojure 1.4 By Default

Pantomime now depends on `org.clojure/clojure` version `1.4.0`. It is still compatible with Clojure 1.3 and if your `project.clj` depends
on 1.3, it will be used, but 1.4 is the default now.

We encourage all users to upgrade to 1.4, it is a drop-in replacement for the majority of projects out there.


## Change Log

We recommend all users to upgrade to [1.5.0](https://clojars.org/com.novemberain/pantomime/versions/1.5.0).

[Pantomime change log](https://github.com/michaelklishin/pantomime/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) is available on GitHub.
