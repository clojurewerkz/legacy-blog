## Clojure Documentation Progress Report

The [Clojure Documentation](http://clojure-doc.org) Site (a.k.a. CDS) publishes
periodic reports to give the Clojure community a better idea of what [clojure-doc.org](http://clojure-doc.org) has to offer.


## New Content

New tuturials:

 * [Vim For Clojure Development](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/vim_fireplace.html)
 * [Growing a DSL with Clojure](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/growing_a_dsl_with_clojure.html)

New guides:

 * [Macros and Metaprogramming in Clojure](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/macros.html)
 * [clojure.core.typed guides](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/ecosystem/core_typed/home.html) are now part of clojure-doc.org


## Updates

Since our last update in November 2012, most of the guides got minor improvements. We won't list
them all here.

## You Can Help!

### How It Works

We have [a repository on GitHub](http://github.com/clojuredocs/cds)
that has Markdown files with content and toolchain setup instructions.
Just pick something that you are very familiar with or interested in
and write.

When you are done, submit a pull request on GitHub and someone from
the existing contributors team will suggest improvements or merge your
work. It is that easy.

In order to make it easier for potential contributors to join the
project, we will post a brief list of guides that do not require deep
expertise and can benefit from contributions by complete beginners.

### Improving Existing Guides

Guides that have structure and good chunk of the content in place but still have holes you
can help us plug:

 * [Java interop](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/interop.html)
 * [Collections and Sequences](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/sequences.html)
 * [Namespaces](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/namespaces.html)
 * [clojure.core Overview](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/core_overview.html)


### Writing New Content

If you want to start working on one of those articles or have existing content you've authored that can be ported,
please let us know on the [Clojure mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/clojure).
