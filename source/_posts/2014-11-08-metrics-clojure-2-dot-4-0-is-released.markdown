## TL;DR

[metrics-clojure](https://github.com/sjl/metrics-clojure/) is a Clojure fa√ßade around Coda Hale's [Metrics](http://metrics.codahale.com) library,
originally developed by [Steve Losh](http://stevelosh.com/).

`metrics-clojure` is not a ClojureWerkz project but we help maintain it
and consider it to be a very valuable library.


## Changes Between 2.3.0 and 2.4.0

### Metrics 3.1.0

`metrics-clojure` is now based on [Metrics 3.1.0](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/metrics-user/zwzHnMBcAX4).

### Improve ring instrumentation.

`metrics-clojure-ring` now instruments the scheme of requests, (http or https).
