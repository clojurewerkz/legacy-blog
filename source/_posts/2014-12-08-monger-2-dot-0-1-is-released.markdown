## TL;DR

Monger is an idiomatic [Clojure MongoDB driver](http://clojuremongodb.info) for a more civilized age.
It has batteries included, offers powerful expressive query DSL, strives to support every MongoDB 2.0+ feature and has sane defaults.
It also has [solid documentation](http://clojuremongodb.info).

`2.0.1` is a compatibility release.
