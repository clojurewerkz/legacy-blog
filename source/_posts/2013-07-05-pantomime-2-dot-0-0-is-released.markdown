## TL;DR

[Pantomime](http://github.com/michaelklishin/pantomime) is a tiny Clojure library for working with
MIME types and file metadata.

Pantomime 2.0 introduces a new (natural) language detection feature built on top of
Apache Tika and *drops support for Clojure 1.3*.

Future versions will likely introduce more functionality built on top of Tika, making
Pantomime more than just a "tiny libarry for working with MIME types").


## Changes between Pantomime 1.8.0 and 2.0.0

### Clojure 1.3 is No Longer Supported

Pantomime `2.0` drops support for Clojure 1.3.

### Language Detection Support

`pantomime.languages` is a new namespace that provides functions for
detecting natural languages:

``` clojure
(require '[pantomime.languages :as pl])

(pl/detect-language "this is English, it should not be hard to detect")
;= "en"

(pl/detect-language "parlez-vous Fran√ßais")
;= "fr"
```
